# NMA 3012 Final (Fall 2018)

**Artist Statement**<br>
I like to draw. It’s been a hobby of mine since I was a kid. I remember starting off tracing pictures of Squidward and neopets. In middle school a friend introduced me to anime. Now I’m not into that stuff anymore but it definitely influenced my artstyle a lot. Eventually I moved onto drawing all digitally. I was met with both praise and criticism but I remember the one thing that used to make me most self conscious was the fact that people would often say “oh it’s anime.” Not even western cartoony styles were met with the same snarky tone.

So I wanted to show that yes, styles that happen to look like anime can be beautiful too. And that there are benefits to digital art, things that you can do better using digital art as opposed to  traditional. 

The world is changing and people could stand to have a more open mind. 


**Basics**<br>
Since the idea is for the project to be a digital art gallery, 2/3 chosen art pieces are interactive. 
The three art pieces I chose to include in this mini gallery are as follows:<br>

**Controls**<br>
There are various key presses that are included as directions in the project itself. Some of these include pressed the arrow keys to progress, etc. 
Within the first drawing, the viewer can wait for the image to pointillize by itself, or they can simply move the mouse to fill it in if they are impatient. 

Within the second drawing, the viewer can add to the atmosphere of the drawing by either clicking the mouse to add effects, or by holding the mouse clicks for a more pronounced effect. 

The third drawing is more of a visual digital piece and does not require viewer input. 

**Inspiration**<br>
My inspiration was the [open processing gallery](https://www.openprocessing.org/browse/#) itself, where anyone can look at sketches that have been shared -- some of which are interactive.
